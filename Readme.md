This is the repository of the R package 'sigident'. It provides core functionalities to identify diagnostic and prognostic signatures from gene expression datasets.

Currently implemented features are:

- merging of microarray datasets (via the R package [`sigident.preproc`](https://github.com/kapsner/sigident.preproc.git))
- DEG analysis and functional analysis (via the R package [`sigident.func`](https://github.com/kapsner/sigident.func.git))
- Identification and validation of diagnostic signatures, using
  + Lasso regression
  + Elastic net regression
  + glmnet (grid search for best alpha and lambda)
- Identification of prognostic signatures

# Installation

You can install *sigident* with the following commands in R:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kapsner/sigident")
```

The version of the package, which was used for the publication [A Toolbox for Functional Analysis and the Systematic Identification of Diagnostic and Prognostic Gene Expression Signatures Combining Meta-Analysis and Machine Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/11/10/1606) can anytime be reproduced using the version tag *v0.0.2* during the installation process:

```r
devtools::install_github("miracum/clearly-sigident", ref = "v0.0.2")
```

# Example

Please view the [package's vignette](vignettes/) to see a detailled description how to prepare datasets in order to be suitable for usage with the `sigident` package and to learn, how to perform merging, signature and functional analyses of microarray data.

Since the building the package vignette takes rather long (~ 40 min.), we provide the already built vignettes in [this repository](https://github.com/miracum/clearly-sigident_vignettes). 

# Notice 

The *sigident* package is under active development and not on CRAN yet - this means, that from time to time, the API can break, due to extending and modifying its functionality. It can also happen, that previoulsy included functions and/or function arguments are no longer supported. 
However, a detailed package vignette will be provided alongside with every major change in order to describe the currently supported workflow.
